# implementing-simple-adt-cpp
This is a simple C++ program that implements an ADT-style. 
The clock struct contains fields for the hour, minute, and second. 
The program includes functions for creating a clock, getting and setting the hour, minute, and second, checking if a clock is valid, checking if two clocks are equal, adding two clocks, and printing a clock.

# Usage
To use the clock program, simply run the compiled executable clock. The program creates three clocks (c1, c2, and c3) with different times and performs various operations on them. The program outputs the times of c1 and c2, the hour of c1 and the second of c2, the sum of c1 and c2, and whether c1 is equal to c2.

This program was created based on an exercise in the book "Object-Oriented Programming in C++" by Robert Lafore.
